# DX Anlaysis POC

## Summary
This POC demonstrates a new architecture for our SDKs.

## Key improvements:
* Unified interface for all products
* Typed SDKs for all products
* Easy migration from static SDK to generated typed SDKs
* Products as Plugins
  * Centralized configuration, logging, privacy, user
  * Product interfaces allow for easy extension
* Improved user management
  * Centralized across products
  * Improved server interfaces (multitenant)
* Cross-product communication
  * One product can integrate with others as soon as they are added
  * 3rd parties plugins can hook into the event bus for quick, flexible integrations

## TODO
* Group management
* Environment support (codegen)

## Project structure
* `README.md` - you are here *
* `src/`
  * [App.tsx](src/App.tsx) - Example user app using Amply SDK. A good place to start.
* `src/@amplitude/` - Static "untyped" SDK sources. These would be hosted as packages on NPM.
  * [@amplitude/amplitude](src/@amplitude/amplitude)
  * [@amplitude/analytics](src/@amplitude/analytics)
  * [@amplitude/experiment](src/@amplitude/experiment)
  * [@amplitude/user](src/@amplitude/user)
* `src/amplitude/` - Generated "typed" SDK sources. Would be generated by `ampli pull`
  * [browser](src/amplitude/browser.ts)
  * [node](src/amplitude/node.ts)
* `src/examples/`
  * [1-core-sdk-usage.ts](src/examples/1-core-sdk-usage.ts) - *Untyped* usage of Amplitude SDK
  * [2-typed-sdk-usage.ts](src/examples/2-typed-sdk-usage.ts) - *Typed* usage of Amplitude SDK
  * [3-core-to-typed-sdk-migration.ts](src/examples/3-core-to-typed-sdk-migration.ts) - Migrating from *untyped* to *typed* SDK
  * [4-product-plugins.ts](src/examples/4-product-plugins.ts) - Amplitude plugins
  * [5-multiple-users-on-a-server.ts](src/examples/5-multiple-users-on-a-server.ts) - Server usage with multiple Users
  * [6-cross-platform-usage.ts](src/examples/6-cross-platform-usage.ts) - Client/server hybrid applications
  * [7-cross-plugin-communication.ts](src/examples/7-cross-plugin-communication.ts) - Centralized event bus for decoupled hooks
  * [8-plugin-configuration.ts](src/examples/8-plugin-configuration.ts) - Configuring plugins
